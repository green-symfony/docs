For your project you should install the following:
- [php](https://github.com/green-symfony/docs/blob/main/docs/php%20installation.md)
- [composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)
- [git_bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

By the way, one of the possible way of installing the php is to install [Open Server](https://ospanel.io/download/).
